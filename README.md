Harder, better, faster, stronger

This project was created as a tribute to the memory of [CTU-TimeTableGenerator](https://github.com/antoninkriz/CTU-TimeTableGenerator) and [CTU-TimeTableGenerator-new](https://github.com/antoninkriz/CTU-TimeTableGenerator-new) - older variants written in C++, Python, Bash and some React. Rest in peace.


## Usage

Just open [the website](https://antoninkriz.github.io/CTU-TimeTable-Generator/) - no more downloading, installing, compiling, generating auth tokens and crying!


## Data

You don't need to login or generate any auth tokens. The data are fetched every 2 hours or so (check [`fetch-data.yml`](https://github.com/antoninkriz/CTU-TimeTable-Generator/blob/main/.github/workflows/fetch-data.yml)) from the KOS API. If you have a better strategy, which doesn't include frying the KOS API every minute, please let me know. ‚ù§


## Components

- `kos-loader` - Loads data from the KOS API
- `ctu-timetable-generator` - User-facing app


## Development

See `README.md` in each component's folder.
